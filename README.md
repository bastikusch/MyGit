# birdmigration webapp

ToDo:
- Update Menu to fully focus on deatiled dynamic (right now partly dummy randomwalk inputs) -> add more input controlled parameters
- Add Function for adjusted dynamic over Land/Water (maybe difficult, no real package like matlab overLandOrWater)
- Change visualization package from amcharts to d3.js (if desired, will be a little more time consuming then the rest)
- Add extended/adjusted magnetic field, maybe with overlay in app
