# birdmigration webapp

ToDo:

- [x] Implement Tab Bar menu 
- [x] Add report window, that gives feedback/statistics to the simulation runs: _not yet filled with data though._
- [x] Add existing bird data to visuaisation: _Function is written, waiting for data_
- [x] Write github documentation for the birdmigration app
- [x] Comment code

__Failed:__ Add extended/adjusted magnetic field, maybe with overlay in app: _did not work within framework/dataset yet._
