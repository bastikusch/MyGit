# birdmigration webapp

ToDo:

- [x] Implement Tab Bar menu 
- [x] Add report window, that gives feedback/statistics to the simulation runs: _not yet filled with data though._
- [ ] Add extended/adjusted magnetic field, maybe with overlay in app: _did not work within framework/dataset yet._
- [ ] Add existing bird data to visuaisation: _Function is written, data just has to be added and read in (in real time) as .csv_
- [ ] Write github documentation for the birdmigration app
- [ ] Comment code
